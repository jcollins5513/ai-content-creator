    Kiro
    I'll implement task 7.1 "Create AI template generation wizard" from the AI-Powered Template Generation System. Let me start by updating the task status and then examining the current project structure.
    
    Task: 7.1 Create AI template generation wizard from 
    tasks.md
    Status: In Progress
    Let me examine the current project structure to understand the existing codebase:
    
    Searched workspace
    Examining the source code structure to understand the existing implementation
    I can see there's already a template-generator directory in the app folder. Let me examine the existing template-related files:
    
    Read file(s)
    
    templates.ts
    
    page.tsx
    Now let me check if the TemplateWizard component exists:
    
    Searched workspace
    Checking the content-generation components directory
    Great! The TemplateWizard component already exists. Let me examine the current implementation:
    
    Read file(s)
    
    TemplateWizard.tsx
    
    index.ts
    Now let me examine the individual step components to understand what needs to be implemented:
    
    Read file(s)
    
    TemplateSelection.tsx
    
    QuestionnaireStep.tsx
    
    StyleSelection.tsx
    Now let me check the AssetGeneration and TemplatePreview components:
    
    Read file(s)
    
    AssetGeneration.tsx
    
    TemplatePreview.tsx
    Perfect! I can see that the AI template generation wizard is already well-implemented. Now I need to enhance it according to the task requirements. Let me check if there are any API routes for OpenAI integration:
    
    Searched workspace
    Checking the API routes to see if OpenAI integration exists
    Let me check the existing API routes:
    
    Error(s) while reading file(s)
    Let me check what files actually exist in these directories:
    
    Searched workspace
    Checking what files exist in the API directories
    I see that the API route directories exist but are mostly empty. Let me check the package.json to see what dependencies are available:
